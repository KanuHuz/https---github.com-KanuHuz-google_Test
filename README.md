Python + Pytest Selenium Framework
This repository contains a simple Python and Pytest-based Selenium framework for automated web testing. The framework utilizes Selenium WebDriver to interact with web pages and Pytest for test organization and execution. With this framework, you can easily write and run automated tests for web applications.

Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Pip: Ensure you have the latest version of pip installed to manage Python packages.

Running Tests
To execute the tests, simply run the following command from the root of the repository:
